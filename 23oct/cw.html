    <!-- Create a system that stores information about books. Each book has a title, author, and price. Your task is to:
    Create a class named Book.
    Use a constructor to initialize the book title, author, and price.
    Use getter methods to return the book title and author.
    Use a setter method to update the book price only if it is a number and greater than 0.
    Create one object of the Book class, try updating the price using both valid and invalid values, and print the final 
    book details. -->
