    <!-- Create a simple web-based event reminder tool. The page should take a user's input of a past date (for example, their last birthday) and display:
        The year, month (name, not number), and day of that date.
        How many full years have passed since that date.
        A custom message that says:
        “It has been more than a year since that date.”
        or “It has been less than a year since that date.” -->
